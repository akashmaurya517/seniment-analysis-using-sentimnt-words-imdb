    "It is a natural language processing problem where text is understood and the underlying intent is predicted. Here, you need to  predict the sentiment of movie reviews as either positive or negative in Python using the Keras deep learning library.\n",

    "The dataset is the Large Movie Review Dataset often referred to as the IMDB dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) (often referred to as the IMDB dataset) contains 25,000 highly polar movie reviews (good or bad) for training and the same amount again for testing. The problem is to determine whether a given moving review has a positive or negative sentiment.  Reviews have been preprocessed, and each review is encoded as a sequence of word indexes (integers)."
